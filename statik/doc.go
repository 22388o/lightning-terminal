/*
This package does not contain any source code by default other than this
comment.

The web application's static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) will
be packaged, compressed, then converted to go code and saved to a file called
`statik.go` in this package during the build process.

Run the command `make statik-build` in the root directory to explicitly trigger
that part of the build or simply run `make build` to build the entire
application.
